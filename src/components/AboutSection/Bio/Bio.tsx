        I am a full-stack web developer specialized in frontend with a passion
        for creating beautiful and functional websites.
        <br />
        <br />
        I worked for 6 months at a fintech startup and almost 3 years at
        SogetiLabs France, the R&D department of Sogeti France gathering the 1%
        expert in development.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am currently working as a freelancer. Thanks to my experience at the
        SogetiLabs, I am used to working in an international environment with
        people from all around the world.
        <br />
        <br />
        Also I am used to working in an agile environment with the Scrum
        methodology and to produce clean code, applying the best practices.
